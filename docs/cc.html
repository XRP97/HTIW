                    <p class="">
                        Today cybercrime causes huge problems for society personally, financially, and even in matters
                        of national security.
                    </p>
                    Just in the last few years hundreds of millions of credit card numbers have been stolen, tens of
                    millions of Social Security numbers and healthcare records were compromised, even nuclear
                    centrifuges that have been hacked, and unmanned aerial drones have been hijacked. This is all done
                    by exploiting vulnerabilities in hardware and software or more often by taking advantage of
                    unintentional decisions made by the people using the software.
                    <p>
                        People committing these cyber crimes don't a single profile or motivation it could be anyone
                        from an international terrorist to a teenager competing for bragging rights. Today the largest
                        countries not only have a regular army but also have a well armed cyber army. In fact the next
                        World War may not be fought with traditional weapons, but with computers used to shut down
                        national water supplies, energy grids, and transportation systems. Now let's take a look at how
                        cybercrime works under the hood will learn about software viruses, denial-of-service attacks,
                        and phishing scams. In biology and life, a virus is an organism that is spread by coughing,
                        sneezing, or physical contact. Viruses work by infecting cells, injecting their genetic
                        material, and using those cells to replicate. They can make people really sick and then spread
                        to other people. A computer virus works bit similarly. A virus is an executable program that
                        gets installed, usually unintentionally, and harms the user and their computer. It's also
                        possible for a virus to spread itself to other computers. Now how does a virus get on your
                        computer in the first place? There are a couple ways an attacker can infect someone's computer.
                        They might lure a victim into installing a program with deception about the program's purpose,
                        so for example a lot of viruses are disguised as security updates. It's also possible that the
                        software on your computer has a vulnerability, so an attacker can install itself without even
                        needing explicit permission. Once a virus is on your computer it can steal or delete any of your
                        files, control other programs, or even allow someone else to remotely control your
                        computer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Using computer viruses, hackers can take over millions of computers world wide and then use them
                        as a digital army, otherwise known as a botnet, to attack and take down websites. This kind of
                        attack is called a distributed denial of service. A denial of service is when hackers overwhelm
                        a website with too many requests. We call it a distributed denial-of-service when the attack
                        comes from many computers all at once. Most websites are ready to respond to millions of
                        requests a day, but if you hit them with billions or trillions of requests, coming from
                        different places, the computers are overloaded and stop responding. Another trick used by
                        cybercriminals is to send large amounts of spam email in an attempt to trick people into sharing
                        sensitive personal information. This is called a phishing scam. A phishing scam is when you get
                        what seems like a trustworthy email asking you to log into your account, but clicking the email
                        takes you to a fake website. if you log in anyway you've been tricked into giving your password
                        away. Hackers can then use your login credentials to access your real accounts to steal
                        information or maybe even to steal your money. Fortunately there are many companies, laws, and
                        government organizations working to make the internet safer, but these efforts are not enough.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You may think when a computer system gets hacked the problem was the security design or the
                        software. Ninety percent of the time the system gets hacked however, it's not because of the
                        security bug, but because of a simple mistake made by a human. It turns out there are steps we
                        can all take to protect ourselves. Often your actions not only impact the security of your own
                        data and computer, but the security of everyone at your school, workplace, and home. With
                        billions or trillions of dollars at stake cybercriminals get smarter each year and we all need
                        to keep up.
