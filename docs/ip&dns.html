                    <p class="">
                        Let's talk about how the internet works.
                    </p>
                    The world relies on networks being able to talk with one another, but back in the 1970s there was no
                    standard method for this. It took the work of Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn to invent the internetworking
                    protocol, to make communication possible. This invention laid the groundwork for what we now call
                    the internet. The internet is a network of networks. It links billions of devices together all
                    around the globe. So maybe you're connected with a laptop or a phone through wifi, then that wifi
                    connection connects to an internet service provider (or ISP), and that ISP connects you to billions
                    and billions of devices around the world through hundreds of thousands of networks that are all
                    interconnected. One thing that most people do not appreciate is that the internet is really a design
                    philosophy and an architecture expressed in a set of protocols. <p>
                    A bit can be described as any pair of opposites: on or off, yes or no. We typically use a 1 meaning
                    on, or a 0 meaning off. Because a bit has two possible states we call it binary code. 8 bits strung
                    together makes 1 byte. 1000 bytes all together is a kilobyte. 1000 kilobytes is a megabyte. A song
                    is typically encoded using about 3-4MB. It doesn't matter if it's a picture, a video, or a song,
                    everything on the Internet is represented and sent around as bits. These are the atoms of
                    information. But it's not like we're physically sending 1s and 0s from one place to another or one
                    person to another.
                </p>
                    <p>
                        A protocol is a well known set of rules and standards, that if all parties agree to use it will
                        allow them to communicate without trouble. How the internet actually physically works is less
                        important than the fact that this design philosophy has allowed the internet to adapt and absorb
                        new communication technologies. This is because in order for a new technology to use the
                        internet in some fashion, it just needs to know which protocols to work with. All the different
                        devices on the internet have unique addresses. An address on the internet is just a number,
                        similar to a phone number or a sort of street address, that's unique to each computer or device
                        at the edge of the network. This is similar to how most homes and businesses have a mailing
                        address. You don't need to know a person to send them a letter in the mail, but you do need to
                        know their address and how to write the address properly so the letter can be carried by a mail
                        system to its destination. The addressing system for computers on the internet is similar and it
                        forms part of one of the most important protocols used in internet communication simply called
                        the internet protocol or IP.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A computer's address then is called its IP address. Visiting a website is really just your
                        computer asking another computer for information. Your computer sends a message to the other
                        computer's IP address and it also sends along its origin address, so the other computer knows
                        where to send its response. You may have seen an IP address. It's just a bunch of numbers! These
                        numbers are organized in a hierarchy. Just like a home address has a country, a city, a street,
                        and a house number, an IP address has many parts. Just like all digital data, each of these
                        numbers is represented in bits. Traditional IP addresses are 32 bits long, with 8 bits for each
                        part of the address. The earlier numbers usually identify the country and regional network of
                        the device. Then come the subnetworks, and then finally the address of the specific device. This
                        version of IP addressing is called IPv4.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It was designed in 1973 and was widely adopted in the early 80s, and provides for more than 4
                        billion unique addresses for devices connecting to the internet. But the internet has turned out
                        to be much more popular than even Vint Cerf imagined and 4 billion unique addresses won't be
                        enough. We're now in the middle of a multi-year transition to a longer IP address format called
                        IPv6, which uses 128 bits per address and provides over 340 undecillion unique addresses. That's
                        more than enough for every grain of sand on Earth to have its own IP address. Most users never
                        see or care about internet addresses. A system called the domain name system or DNS associates
                        names like www.example.com with the corresponding addresses. Your computer uses the DNS to look
                        up domain names and get the associated IP address which is used to connect your computer to the
                        destination on the internet. So how do we design a system for billions of devices to find any
                        one of billions of different websites? There is no way one DNS server can handle all the
                        requests from all devices.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The answer is that DNS servers are connected in a distributed hierarchy, and are divided into
                        zones, splitting up responsibility for the major domains such as .org, .com, .net, etc. DNS was
                        originally created to be an open and public communication protocol for government and
                        educational institutions. Because of its openness, DNS is susceptible to cyber attacks. An
                        example attack is DNS spoofing. That's when a hacker taps into a DNS server and changes it to
                        match a domain name with the wrong IP address. This lets the attacker send people to an imposter
                        website. If this happens to you, you are vulnerable for more problems because you are using that
                        fake website as if it's real. The internet is huge and getting bigger everyday. But the domain
                        name system and internet protocol are designed to scale, no matter how much the internet
                        grows. </p>
