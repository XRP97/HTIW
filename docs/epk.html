                    <p class="">
                        The Internet is an open and public system. We all send and receive information over shared wires
                        and connections. But even though it's an open system we still exchange a lot of private data.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Things like credit card numbers, bank information, passwords, and emails. So how is all this
                        private
                        stuff kept secret? Data of any kind can be kept secret through a process known as encryption,
                        the
                        scrambling or changing of the message to hide the original text. Now decryption is the process
                        of
                        unscrambling that message to make it readable. This is a simple idea, and people have been doing
                        it
                        for centuries.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One of the first well known methods of encryption was Caesar's Cipher. Named after Julius
                        Caesar, a Roman general who encrypted his military commands to make sure that if a message was
                        intercepted by enemies, they wouldn't be able to read it. Caesar Cipher is an Algorithm that
                        substitutes each letter in the original message with a letter a certain number of steps down the
                        alphabet. If the number is something only the sender and receiver know, then it's called the
                        key. It allows the reader to unlock the secret message. For example, if your original message is
                        'HELLO' then using the Caesar Cipher algorithm with a key of 5 the encrypted message would be
                        this... To decrypt the message, the recipient would simple use the key to reverse the processes.
                        But there is a big problem with Caesar Cipher, anybody can easily break or crack the encrypted
                        message, by trying every possible key, and in the english alphabet there are only 26 letters,
                        which means you would only need to try at most 26 keys to decrypt the message. Now trying 26
                        possible keys isn't very hard, it would take at most an hour or two.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So lets make it harder. Instead of shifting every letter by the same amount, let's shift each
                        letter by a different amount. In this example a ten digit key shows how many positions each
                        successive letter will be changed to encrypt a longer message. Guessing this key would be really
                        hard. Using 10 digit encryption there could be 10 billion possible key solutions. Obviously
                        that's more then any human could ever solve, it would take many centuries. But an average
                        computer today, would take just a few seconds to try all 10 billion possibilities. So in a
                        modern world were the bad guys are armed with computers instead of pencils how can you encrypt
                        messages so securely that they're too hard to crack? Now too hard means that there are too many
                        possibilities to compute in a reasonable amount of time. Today's secure communications are
                        encrypted using 256 bit keys. That means a bad guy's computer that intercepts your message would
                        need to try this many possible options... until they discover the key and crack the message.
                        Even if you had a 100,000 super computers and each of them was able to try a million billion
                        keys every second it would take trillions of trillions of years to try every option, just to
                        crack a single message protected with 256 bit encryption.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Of course computer chips get twice as fast and half the size every year or so. If that pace of
                        exponential progress continues, today's impossible problems will be solvable just a few hundred
                        years in the future and 256 bits won't be enough to be safe. In fact we've already had to
                        increase the standard key length to keep up with the speed of computers. The good news is using
                        a longer key doesn't make encrypting messages much harder but it exponentially increases the
                        number of guesses that it would take to crack a cipher. When the sender and receiver share the
                        same key to scramble and unscramble a message its called Symmetric Encryption. With Symmetric
                        Encryption, like Caesar Cipher, the secret key has to be agreed on ahead of time by two people
                        in private. So that's great for people, but the internet is open and public so it's impossible
                        for two computers to "meet" in private to agree on a secret key. Instead computers use
                        Asymmetric Encryption keys, a public key that can be exchanged with anybody and a private key
                        that is not shared. The Public Key is used to encrypt data and anybody can use it to create a
                        secret message, but the secret can only be decrypted by a computer with access to the private
                        key. How this works is with some math that we won't get into right now.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Think of it this way, imagine that you have a personal mailbox, where anybody can deposit mail
                        but they need a key to do it. Now you can make many copies of the deposit key and send one to
                        your friend or even just make it publicly available. Your friend or even a stranger can use the
                        public key to access your deposit slot and drop a message in, But only you can open the mailbox
                        with your private key, to access all of the secret messages you've received. And you can send a
                        secure message back to your friend by using the public deposit key to their mailbox. This way
                        people can exchange secure messages without ever needing to agree on a private key. Public Key
                        cryptography is the foundation of all secure messaging on the open internet. Including the
                        Security Protocols known as SSL and TLS, which protect us when we are browsing the web. Your
                        computer uses this today, anytime you see the little lock or the letters https in your browser's
                        address bar. This means your computer is using public key encryption to exchange data securely
                        with the website you're on. As more and more people get on the internet more and more private
                        data will be transmitted, and the need to secure that data will be even more important. And as
                        computers become faster and faster we will have to develop new ways to make encryption too hard
                        for computers to break.
