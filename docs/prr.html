                        How is it possible for every piece of data to be delivered to you reliably?

                        Say you want to play a Video from Youtube. It seems like your computer connects directly to
                        Youtube webservers and sends you a video on a direct, dedicated line. Actually, that's not how
                        the internet works. If the internet were made of direct, dedicated connections it would be
                        impossible to keep things working as millions of users join. Especially since there is no
                        guarantee that every wire and computer is working all the time. Instead, data travels on the
                        internet in a much less direct fashion.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The way information gets transferred from one computer to another is pretty interesting. It need
                        not follow a fixed path, in fact, your path may change in the midst of a computer to computer
                        conversation. Information on the internet goes from one computer to another in what we call a
                        packet of information and a packet travels from one place to another on the internet a lot like
                        how you might get from one place to another in a car. Depending on traffic congestion or road
                        conditions, you might choose or be forced to take a different route to get to the same place
                        each time you travel. And just as you can transport all sorts of stuff inside a car, many kinds
                        of digital information can be sent with IP packets but there are some limits. What if for
                        example you need to move a space shuttle from where it was built to where it will be launched.
                        The shuttle won't fit in one truck so it needs to be broken down into pieces, transported using
                        a fleet of trucks. They could all take different routes and might get to the destination at
                        different times. But once all the pieces are there, you can reassemble the pieces into the
                        complete shuttle and it will be ready for launch. On the internet the details work similarly. If
                        you have a very large image that you want to send to a friend or upload to a website, that image
                        might be made up of 10s of millions of bits of 1s and 0s, too many to send along in one packet.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since it's data on a computer, the computer sending the image can quickly break it into hundreds
                        or even thousands of smaller parts called packets. Unlike cars or trucks these packets don't
                        have drivers and they don't choose their route. Each packet has the internet address of where it
                        came from and where it's going. Special computers on the internet called routers/modems act like
                        traffic managers to keep the packets moving through the networks smoothly. If one route is
                        congested, individual packets may travel different routes through the internet and they may
                        arrive at the destination at slightly different times or even out of order. Let's talk about how
                        this works. As part of the internet protocol, every router keeps track of multiple paths for
                        sending packets, and it chooses the cheapest available path for each piece of data based on
                        destination IP address for the packet. Cheapest in this case doesn't mean cost, but time and
                        non-technical factors such as politics and relationships between companies. </p>
                    <p>
                        Often the best route for data to travel isn't necessarily the most direct. Having options for
                        paths makes the network fault tolerant. Which means the network can keep sending packets even if
                        something goes horribly, horribly wrong. This is the basis for a key principle of the internet:
                        reliability. Now, what if you want to request some data and not everything is delivered? Say you
                        want to watch a video. How can you be 100% sure all the data will be delivered so the video
                        plays perfectly? Introducing your new best friend, TCP (transmission control protocol). TCP
                        manages the sending and receiving of all your data as packets. Think of it like a guaranteed
                        mail service. When you request a video on your device, Youtube sends a video broken up into many
                        packets. When your packets arrive, TCP does a full inventory and sends back acknowledgements of
                        each packet received. If all packets are there, TCP signs for your delivery and you're done.If
                        TCP finds some packets are missing, it won't sign, otherwise your video won't sound as good or
                        portions of the video could be missing. For each missing or incomplete packet, Youtube will
                        resend them. Once TCP verifies the delivery of many packets for that one video request, your
                        video will start to play. What's great about the TCP and router systems is they're scalable.
                        They can work with 8 or 8 billion devices.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In fact, because of these principles of fault tolerance and redundancy, the more routers and
                        modems we add the more reliable the internet becomes. What's also great is we can grow and scale
                        the internet without interrupting service for anybody using it. The internet is made of hundreds
                        of thousands of networks and billions of computers and devices connected physically. These
                        different systems that make up the internet connect to each other, communicate with each other,
                        and work together because of agreed upon standards for how data is sent around on the internet.
                        Computing devices, or routers along the internet, help all the packets make their way to the
                        destination where they're reassembled, if necessary, in order. This happens billions of times a
                        day, whether you and others are sending an email, visiting a web page, doing a video chat, using
                        a mobile app, or when sensors or devices on the internet talk to each other.
