                    The internet is totally changing how people interact and connect. But how does it work? How do the
                    computers all across the world actually communicate with each other? Let's look at web browsing.
                    First, you open a web browser. It's the app you use to access the web pages. Next, you type in the
                    web address, or URL, which stands for Uniform Resource Locator of the website you want to visit like
                    facebook.com.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So you've probably wondered what actually happens when you type an address into your web browser
                        and then hit enter. And it really is about as crazy as you can imagine. So in that moment your
                        computer starts talking to another computer, called a server, that's usually thousands of miles
                        away. And in milliseconds your computer asks that server for a website, and that server starts
                        to talk back to your computer in a language called HTTP. HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer
                        Protocol. You can kind of think of it as the language that one computer uses to ask another
                        computer for a document. And it's actually really pretty straightforward. If you were to
                        intercept the conversation between your computer and a web server on the internet, it's mainly
                        made up of something called "GET" requests. Those are really very simply the word GET and the
                        name of the document that you're requesting. So if you try to log into Facebook and load our
                        login page, all you're doing is sending a GET request to Facebook's server that says GET /login.
                        And that tells Facebook's server that you want all of the HTML code for the Facebook login page.
                        So HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language and you can think of that as the language you use
                        to tell a web browser how to make a page look. If you think about something like Wikipedia,
                        which is really just a big simple document and HTML is the language that you use to make that
                        title big and bold, to make the font the right font, to link certain text to certain other
                        pages, to make some text bold, to make some text italic, to put an image in the middle of the
                        page, to align the image to the right, to align the image to the left. The text of a web page is
                        included directly in the HTML, but other parts like images or videos are separate files with
                        their own URLs that need to be requested. The browser sends separate HTTP requests for each of
                        these and displays them as they arrive. If a web page has a lot of different images, each of
                        them causes a separate HTTP request and the page loads slower. Now sometimes when you browse the
                        web, you're not just requesting pages with GET requests.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sometimes you send information like when you fill out a form or type a search query. Your
                        browser sends this information in plain text to the web server using an HTTP POST request. Let's
                        say you log in to Facebook. Well the first thing you do is you make a POST request, that is a
                        POST to Facebook's login page that has some data attached to it. It has your email address, it
                        has your password. That goes to Facebook's server. Facebook's server figures out that okay,
                        you're Carl. It sends a web page back to your browser that says, Success! Logged in as Carl. But
                        along with that web page, it also attaches a little bit of invisible cookie data that your
                        browser sees and knows to save. And it's really important because it's really the only way that
                        a website can remember who you are. All that cookie data really is, is an ID card for Facebook.
                        It's a number that identifies you as Carl. And your web browser holds on to that number and the
                        next time you refresh Facebook, the next time you go to Facebook.com, your web browser knows to
                        automatically attach that ID number with the request that it sends over to Facebook's servers.
                        So now Facebook's servers sees the request coming from your browser, sees the ID number, and
                        knows "Ok, this is a request from Carl."
                    <p>
                        Now, the internet is completely open. All of its connections are shared and information is sent
                        in plain text. This makes it possible for hackers to snoop on any personal information that you
                        send over the internet. But safe websites prevent this, by asking your web browser to
                        communicate on a secure channel using something called Secure Sockets Layer and its successor
                        Transport Layer Security. You can think of SSL and TLS as a layer of security wrapped around
                        your communications to protect them from snooping or tampering. SSL and TLS are active when you
                        see the little lock that appears in your browser address bar, next to the HTTPS. The HTTPS
                        protocols ensure that your HTTP requests are secure and protected. When a website asks your
                        browser to engage in a secure connection, it first provides a digital certificate. Which is like
                        an official ID card proving that it's the website it claims to be. Digital certificates are
                        published by certificate authorities, which are trusted entities that verify the identities of
                        websites and issue certificates for them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Just like a government can issue IDs or passports. Now if a website tries to start a secure
                        connection without a properly issued digital certificate, your browser will warn you. That's the
                        basics of web browsing! The part of the internet we see day to day. To summarize, HTTP and DNS
                        manage the sending and receiving of HTML, media files, or anything on the web. What makes this
                        possible under the hood are TCP/IP and router networks that break down and transport information
                        in small packets. Those packets themselves are made up of binary, sequences of 1s and 0s that
                        are physically sent through electric wires, fiber optic cables, and wireless networks.
                        Fortunately, once you've learned how one layer of the internet works, you can rely on it without
                        remembering all the details. And we can trust that all those layers will work together to
                        successively deliver information at scale and with reliability.
