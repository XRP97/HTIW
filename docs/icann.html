                    </h1>
                    <p>
                    To reach another person on the Internet you have to type an address into your computer - a name or a number. That address has to be unique so computers know where to find each other. ICANN coordinates these unique identifiers across the world. Without that coordination we wouldn't have one global Internet.
                    </p>
                    <P>
                    ICANN was formed in 1998. It is a not-for-profit partnership of people from all over the world dedicated to keeping the Internet secure, stable and interoperable. It promotes competition and develops policy on the Internet’s unique identifiers.
                    </P>
                    <p>
                    ICANN doesn’t control content on the Internet. It cannot stop spam and it doesn’t deal with access to the Internet. But through its coordination role of the Internet’s naming system, it does have an important impact on the expansion and evolution of the Internet.

                    Jon Postel: In 1972, Jon Postel became a volunteer who handed out official socket numbers for the ARPANET network established by Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA), a U.S. Defense agency. When Postel moved to the Information Sciences Institute (ISI) at the University of Southern California (USC) in 1976, he continued the coordinating role, which had evolved to administer other unique identifiers required for the functioning of the Internet.

                    <p>
                    1988 IANA: Postel’s registry eventually became the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), which administered the assignment of Internet names, numbers, and addresses. The term “IANA” was first officially used in RFC 1083, in December 1988, which listed Joyce Reynolds as the IANA contact and Jon Postel as Deputy Internet Architect.

                    Network Solutions, Inc. (NSI) made a successful proposal to provide services including domain name registration and network number assignment and entered into a five-year agreement with a U.S. government agency, the National Science Foundation (NSF). In 1995, the NSF allowed Network Solutions to charge for domain name registration services.

                    <p>
                    The Internet Society (ISOC) and IANA formed the International Ad Hoc Committee (IAHC) to consider a new governance model for top-level domains in response to the expansion and commercialization of the Internet. The IAHC developed a plan called the gTLD-MoU which received opposition from varying parties, including the U.S. Government.

                    </h1>
                    <p>
                    In its Framework for Global Electronic Commerce, the Clinton administration committed to the privatization of DNS management in a manner that would increase competition and facilitate international participation in its management. After comments from stakeholders around the world, the U.S. Department of Commerce drafted the Green Paper, “Proposal to Improve the Technical Management of Internet Names and Addresses,” and later the White Paper, “Management of Internet Names and Addresses.”

                    <p>
                    Diverse stakeholders in the Internet community worked to propose an implementation of the White Paper. The International Forum on the White Paper (IFWP) was formed and was held over four meetings as an open space to bring together the Internet community. IANA proposed a different approach, and on 2 October 1998, Jon Postel sent the Department of Commerce draft Bylaws for a new corporation responsible for DNS management. The draft was then released for public comment and is the basis of ICANN’s original Bylaws.

                    The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) was incorporated in California as a nonprofit public benefit corporation. The original ICANN Bylaws called for three Supporting Organizations: the Address Supporting Organization (ASO), the Domain Names Supporting Organization (DNSO), and the Protocol Supporting Organization (PSO).

                    <p>
                    The history of ICANN traces back to the creation and the evolution of the Internet itself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    In 1969, the first message was sent via the Arpanet, a U.S. Department of Defense network and precursor to the global Internet. Three years later, Jon Postel started to record socket numbers for the Arpanet in his notebook. His registry eventually became the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), which manages the coordination of the Domain Name System (DNS).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    ICANN was founded in 1998 and grew out of a U.S. Government commitment to transfer the policy and technical management of the DNS to a non-profit corporation based in the U.S. with global participation. The IANA Stewardship Transition was completed in October 2016 thanks to the work and dedication of the Internet community worldwide.

                    <p>
                    The ICANN History Project explores the key events in ICANN’s growth, from its birth to its current day status. This project seeks to preserve the organization’s institutional memory by capturing stories from key figures who helped shape ICANN’s past and present. On the History Project pages you will find documents, pictures and videos that helped frame ICANN’s history, and interactive timelines presenting the chronology of significant events.                    </p>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Because the history of ICANN is multifaceted, composed of many different threads, this project is presented through tracks or themes. As the History Project matures, more tracks will be added. This is very much a “living” project that will constantly be evolving and expanding.
